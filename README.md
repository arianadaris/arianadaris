<h3>I am an impact-driven full-stack developer who is passionate about finding beautiful solutions to not-so-beautiful problems.</h3>
<p>I'm a senior at Arizona State University, graduating with a <strong>Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering. </strong>Outside of school, I enjoy learning about <strong>front-end development and UX/UI design.</strong> Iâ€™m a people person, and I love that I can use code to get to know people and create something beautiful with them! With front-end development, itâ€™s a gratifying feeling seeing how a few lines of code can make the biggest difference for someone else.</p>
